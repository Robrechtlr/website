            <p>
                Hi, I'm Robrecht! I am 26 years old and live in Belgium. I am a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> / <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> alum and I was previously working on an (intercom-style) live stream widget for ecommerce stores. During my work on previous startups, one of the things that remained the same was my interest in web3. I want to build something in the web3 space and I am looking for a like-minded person to work with as co-founders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h4>
                <mark>About me:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am a result-driven person with an interest in web3, product design, and investing. While I am not a deeply technical founder, one of my previous co-founders says “don’t let anyone say you’re not technical”. <br><br> Here is an overview of my skillset:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>UI/UX design (Adobe XD/Figma)</li>
                <li>3D design (Blender)</li>
                <li>Web design (Webflow & basic JS, React, and Solidity)</li>
                <li>AR design (Spark AR/Lens Studio)</li>
                <li>Web3 tools (Etherscan, Metamask, Opensea, Uniswap, etc)</li>
                <li>Operations (Setting up processes, working with 3rd party software, working with legal/accounting, etc.) aka, I will take care of all the work that bores you</li>
                <li>Business development/sales</li>
                <li>Fundraising</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, I am a resourceful person that can wear a lot of hats.
            </p>
            <p>
                When times get tough and we get into a heated discussion I am a diplomatic person. Quoting one of my previous co-founders again: you’re unnaturally level-headed; not easily triggered; and able to bring a mature response to points of contention.
            </p>

                <mark>Impressive Accomplishment:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Met co-founders online, started building a product, won Pioneer tournament, got first paying customers, and funded by YC in the span of 2-3 months.

                <mark>What do I want to work on:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Here are a few concepts I am passionate about working on in no particular order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building a software product for web3 (investing/gaming related is a plus but not necessary)</li>
                <li>Building a web3 trading fund (MEV, Defi, NFTs, etc.)</li>
                <li>Building/3D designing for the metaverse (e.g. <a href="https://rtfkt.com/">RTFKT</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">

                <mark>Co-founder preferences:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am looking for a technical co-founder, depending on what we are building the skillset can vary.
                <br>
                <br>
                In general a person who:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is passionate about the web3 space</li>
                <li>Wants to give this a real shot</li>
                <li>Friendly and casual yet focussed and passionate</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                We can start with doing a few video calls to get to know each other better. Feel free to reach out if this sounds interesting to you! (I am open to relocating to a tech hub, if/when it makes sense) <br><br>
