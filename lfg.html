            <p>
                Hi, I'm Robrecht! I am 27 years old and live in Belgium. I am a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target=”_blank”>YC alum</a> and part of the <a href="https://www.orangedao.xyz/" target=”_blank”>Orange&nbsp;DAO</a> venture team. Previously, I worked on Soulbind, an easy way to create, issue, and manage soulbound tokens and we had a small exit to one of our customers.
                <br><br> I want to start working on something new in the crypto/web3 space and I am looking for a like-minded person to work with as a co-founder (I am open to relocating to a tech hub if/when it makes sense).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h4>
                <mark>About me:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am a result-driven person with a good understanding of the crypto/web3 market, product design, customer discovery/sales, and growth. While I am not a technical founder, I am able to write basic code and discuss technical concepts. One of my previous co-founders says “don’t let anyone say you’re not technical”.
                <br><br> Here is an overview of my skillset:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Growth strategies</li>
                <li>Product design (Adobe XD/Figma)</li>
                <li>Customer discovery/sales</li>
                <li>Web design (Webflow, basic html/css/js)</li>
                <li>3D & AR design (Blender, Lens Studio)</li>
                <li>Operations (aka, I will take care of all the work that bores you.)</li>
                <li>Fundraising</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, I am a resourceful person who can wear many hats. I reach my full potential when working together with a technical co-founder who wants to build the product and I can take care of most of the other work.
            </p>
            <p>
                When times get tough and we get into a heated discussion I am a diplomatic person. Quoting one of my previous co-founders again: you’re unnaturally level-headed; not easily triggered; and able to bring a mature response to points of contention.
            </p>
