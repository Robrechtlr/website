            <p>
                Hi, I'm Robrecht! I am 26 years old and live in Belgium. I am a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target=”_blank”>Y Combinator</a> alum and <a href="https://www.orangedao.xyz/" target=”_blank”>OrangeDAO</a> contributor. During the last few months, I worked on <a href="https://www.soulbind.app/" target=”_blank”>Soulbind</a>, an easy way to create, issue, and manage soulbound tokens (acquired).
                <br><br> I want to start working on something new in the crypto/web3 space and I am looking for a like-minded person to work with as a co-founder.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h4>
                <mark>About me:</mark>
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am a result-driven person with a good understanding of the crypto/web3 market, customer discovery, and product design. While I am not a deeply technical founder, I am able to write basic code and discuss technical concepts. One of my previous co-founders says “don’t let anyone say you’re not technical”.
                <br><br> Here is an overview of my skillset:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer discovery/sales</li>
                <li>Product design (Adobe XD/Figma)</li>
                <li>Web design (Webflow, basic JS & React)</li>
                <li>3D design (Blender)</li>
                <li>AR design (Spark AR/Lens Studio)</li>
                <li>Operations (Setting up processes, working with 3rd party software, working with legal/accounting, etc.) aka, I will take care of all the work that bores you.</li>
                <li>Fundraising</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, I am a resourceful person that can wear a lot of hats. I reach my full potential when working together with a technical co-founder who wants to build the product and I can take care of most of the other work.
            </p>
            <p>
                When times get tough and we get into a heated discussion I am a diplomatic person. Quoting one of my previous co-founders again: you’re unnaturally level-headed; not easily triggered; and able to bring a mature response to points of contention.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am open to relocating to a tech hub if/when it makes sense.
            </p>

            </h4>
            <p>
                Met co-founders online, started building a product, won <a href="https://pioneer.app/" target=”_blank”>Pioneer</a> tournament, got first paying customers, and funded by YC in the span of 2-3 months.

            <p>
                Had a small exit from my previous crypto startup (Soulbind).

                While there are certain areas that particularly excite me and that I am eager to work on, I remain open to exploring and contributing to other facets of the field as well.
